= Static Website Hosting on S3

If you want to serve a static website, you can serve it via S3 without a server.

This recipe is consist of:

- S3 bucket to keep your static file like `.html`, `.js`, `.css` moreover.
- CloudFront to serve static files with CDN.
- A domain linked with CloudFront.
- HTTPS supported by a certificate issued in
  link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home[ACM]

Terraform can request an ACM certificate, but it is not able to validate it.
You have to create the certificate and validate it by email
before creating other resources.
(e.g. `terraform plan -target=aws_acm_certificate.website`)
